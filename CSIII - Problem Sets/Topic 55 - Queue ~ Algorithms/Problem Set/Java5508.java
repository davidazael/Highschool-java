// Java5508	Consider yourself being a manager at a crowded supermarket 
//			and trying to help the clients minimize the wait at the 
//			busy checkout.
//
//			Design a progam to manage the client traffic using queues. 
//			The checkout has multiple lanes, and each of which can be 
//			managed as a queue. The program uses a random number 
//			generator to determine the arrival of a client to the 
//			checkout and the estimated amount of time the cashier 
//			needs to check out the client.
//
//			The client is always assigned to the shortest lane or 
//			the lane that is expected to move faster (based on the 
//			estimated total checkout time for that lane).
//
//			Move those clients who have waited too long to a shorter 
//			or faster lane. 
//
//			Your program must display in real time how these checkout
//			lanes work, including the number of clients waiting, 
//			the amount of time each client has been in line, and how 
//			they are being directed to other lanes to minimize the wait.
